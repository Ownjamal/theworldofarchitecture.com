<p><h3> As I mentioned in the first page, I will be talking about the house that I designed with my cousin throughout this month, but first I will remind you of the steps that you have to do before building the actual house.</h3></p>
<p><h3> And those steps are mentioned below:</h3></p>
<ol type="1">
<h3>
<li>Finding your concept</li>
<li> 2d or technical drawings</li>
<li>Building the house</li>
</h3>
</ol>

<p><h3>To start with the house, I started thinking for a couple of days of a concept that I should use to design my website, and then eventually I’ve decided that my concept should be the shape of a maple leaf- just like the one on the Canadian flag,
since the shape of the maple leaf is a really easy and cool shape to design and one of the best concepts to build a house from. I started to sketch some things on a piece of paper so I can see what the house would look like from the top, I went then and learned a few tutorials about auto-cad since I did not know anything about it, and I started doing some 2d drawing or technical drawing,
the technical drawings were a really hard step to do, and it had to be repeated about 3 times, and finally, after a month I had the final technical drawing.

<p><h3>So as shown in the picture, there are 2 floors and a roof-top, the first floor is going to be consisting of a playing area, a living room, and 2 bathrooms. While the second floor consists of a master room and a bathroom, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a laundry room, and at last the roof, which consists of a gym, a balcony with a barbeque place, and also a place to sit in.
Auto-cad is a really good application to use for the 2d drawing, since as shown in the picture it helped me add all the furniture that I need to add, and it was detailed.

<p><h3> As shown in the picture, this is the first floor, the building is a really easy step if you follow the tutorial on the first page, and as you see the walls are made out of glass since glass walls are a major thing in any modern house. Other than that, if any of you is trying to build a house, they have to offset the shape of about 25 cm so that they can give the wall thickness, and that makes it look like a house. And besides, the house is going to be a two-car garage.</h3></p>
<img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\personal project\second floor.jpg" alt="first floor" width="543" height="308" style="float:right;margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:5px; border:solid black 1px">
<p><h3> As shown, this is the second floor, this floor is consisting of many rooms, unlike the first floor it does not have a big place to sit in, but all the rooms on this floor look like the shape of a leaf and are big enough for all the furniture. And as you notice, the second floor does not have organized aesthetics for the whole floor, since each room has its unique style.</h3></p>
<img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\personal project\roof.jpg" alt="roof" width="543" height="308" style="float:left;margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px; border:solid black 1px">
<p><h3> As shown here, the roof is an open roof, where it has a balcony, a gym, a bbq place, and a water tank, which makes it a cool place to sit in for the family. Where the gym, consists of many machines that are simple, and the walls are made out of glass. While the balcony has a small sitting area and aa bbq place, and there's also a bbq table inside, and also a soda vending machine.
</h3></p>
<br>
<p><h3> At last, I’ve put all the floors and parts of the house altogether, I had to add some beams to it, and a beam is a horizontal member spanning an opening and carrying a load that may be a brick or stone wall above the opening, in which case the beam is often called a lintel.
So after adding about 3 beams to the house, I have colored the house with the beams with wooden colors and some white bricks colors. After that, I added a maple leaf swimming pool to the backyard, and I also added a front yard. And the house turned out to be as good as I expected.

<p><h3> In conclusion, I hope that this article taught you how to build or design a house, with many detailed steps, and I hope you liked the house I designed on sketch up.
