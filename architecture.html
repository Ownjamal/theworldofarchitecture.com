<p><h3> Any of you wondered before what is architecture, and how do people start designing, or even plan those massive deisgns that we see everyday. 
Well today in this article, i am going to explain the defeinition of Architecture, and explain the steps of planning and designing them by giving an example from the house i designed.

<p><h3> Architecture can be described as both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures.
 Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art.
Architecture is everywhere. Every building: home, school, office, hospital, and supermarket were designed for their particular purpose.
It is of vital importance that these buildings, and in turn the environments they form and the neighborhoods and cities they are a part of, are designed to be the best possible buildings for their specific context, use, and the people who use them.
</h3></p>
<br>
<p><h3>  Architecture seems to be easy, but it's not as easy as it looks, there are many planning and thinking and designing steps that you need to do before starting to build the house on SketchUp.
At first, it all starts with one question, "what is your concept?", and I am sure you're wondering what is a concept, concepts are your inspirations behind your design, and it can be anything around you, maybe a tree, an animal or it can be a specific plant, and it can be called an
The architectural concept, which can be described as an: idea, notion, opinion, abstraction, philosophy, belief, inspiration, thought, intention, theory, image, plan, or hypothesis.
</h3></p>
<p><h3>
An example of a concept is the concept of Burj Khalifa as shown: 
<img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\personal project\burj.jpg" alt="burj" width="499" height="368" style="float:right;margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:5px; border:solid black 1px">
<p><h3>The design of Burj Khalifa is derived from geometries of the desert flower, which is indigenous to the region, and the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture.
The tower massing is organized around a central core with three wings. Each wing consists of four bays.
<br> <br>
Another step that you need to do is sketching your design, and it has to be related to your architectural concept, for example, Burj khalifa was built like a desert flower,
in which all the things inside it is taken from this simple flower, but creativity is also used here. So anything you have in mind should be sketched, even if you want to design rooms and playing areas or bathrooms, they should be all related to your concept.
</h3></p>
<p><h3> The next step that should be done is 2d drawings, using an app called auto-cad. And another name for the 2d drawing is technical drawings,
which is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed. The technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering.
</h3></p>
<img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\personal project\khalifa.jpg" alt="khalifa" width="499" height="368" style="float:left;margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px; border:solid black 1px">
<p><h3> To the left side as shown here is a detailed technical drawing for Burj Khalifa, and as you see it is a 2d drawing from the top perspective, and the top, it is looking like the desert flower, which is the concept of this tower, and if you look more into it, you'll notice that the shapes of the rooms are looking like the seeds inside this flower.
And this is what's called following your concept.
<br> 
And as I mentioned before, many apps can be used to draw technical drawings on, but one of the most ones that are detailed and I particularly liked is auto-cad,
where auto cad can be used to draw those technical drawings, and also change them into 3d, but mostly focuses on 2d drawings. Autocad wasn't that easy to learn, it was hard, so I had to use some tutorials from youtube.

<p><h3> And here is a tutorial as shown below:</h3></p>

</p><h3>
After this step the only thing left is building the house on an app called SketchUp, it can be downloaded or used online, but there are some tutorials that you should watch before working on it, so you know more about it and use it professionally before starting it.
So if you do not know what is SketchUp, it a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications such as architectural, interior design, landscape architecture, civil and mechanical engineering, film and video game design,
SketchUp is owned by Trimble Inc, a mapping surveying and navigation equipment company. There is an online library of free model assemblies (e.g. windows, doors, automobiles), 3D Warehouse, to which users may contribute models. The program includes drawing layout functionality, allows surface rendering in variable "styles", supports third-party "plug-in" programs hosted on a site called Extension Warehouse to provide other capabilities (e.g. near photo-realistic rendering) and enables placement of its models within Google Earth.
